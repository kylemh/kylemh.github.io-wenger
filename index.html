            <p>If you ask anybody that knows about the world of football, Arsène Wenger and Arsenal FC are nearly eponymous synonyms. The success that Arsenal has seen over the 20 years of Wenger's tenure is varied in nature, globally obvious, and one of the most relevant legends of the English Premier League's storied past. Statistics paint a very pretty picture of the Frenchman, but his real beauty lies within the overarching story of Arsenal's identity, its infrastructure, and its players.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Arsenal's Identity:</strong> Before Wenger's arrival, Arsenal's identity was mired with slogans like "boring, boring Arsenal". Since the 1988-1989 season - when Arsenal won the league for the first time in nearly 20 years - Arsenal had been gaining consistent traction as one of the top teams in the Premiership. Arsène started work with a relatively strong squad already at his disposal - utilizing players like Ian Wright, David Seaman, Dennis Bergkamp, and Patrick Vieira. He won the league in his 2nd season with Arsenal, he won it again in 2002, and he did it again in 2004 <strong>without losing a single match...</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <h5><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invincibles_(football)#Arsenal">You read that correctly: 38 matches, no losses, and a 3rd Premier League Title.</a></strong></h5></p>
            <br>
            <p>Only one other team in the history of English football had been able to complete a season without losing (Preston North End in 1889), and no team has done it since. The high-flying plights of Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Robert Pires, Fredrik Ljungberg, Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole, and the rest of the "Invincibles" squad produced some of the finest football that Arsenal has ever fielded. Needless to say, stylishly winning three titles and many other trophies within just 8 years of his arrival made Wenger a god to Arsenal's fandom. As a sidenote, Wenger has never managed an Arsenal team that placed below Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League table - 20 years of dominance over your cross-town rival feels <em>VERY</em> good.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Arsenal's Infrastructure:</strong> Arsène went on to plan the construction of a new Stadium in order to increase revenue for the club, and to maintain Arsenal's status as one of the top football clubs on the planet. The real challenge in moving to a new stadium was remaining competitive despite the financial shackles such a move would entail - he did so with aplomb by placing in the top 4 of the Premier League every season that he managed (also securing a place in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League">UEFA Champion's League</a> for every season he managed). Having placed 3rd in 2015 and 2nd in 2016, Wenger is aiming for a presumed final league title by the end of his 20th season. Assuming his departure comes soon, he'll be leaving behind a legacy that has revolutionized Arsenal, the Premier League, and the entire world of football.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Arsenal's Players:</strong> Wenger oversaw the development of many world-class footballers, including Arsenal's all-time top-scorer, Thierry Henry. He also raised many players up directly from youth squads into the first-squad, such as Ashley Cole, Cesc Fabregas, Jack Wilshere, and Hector Bellerin. While struggling to maintain roster strength during the financially-restrictive years following the construction of the Emirates Stadium, Wenger was able to bring the best out of every player and maintain competitiveness. Finally, he's capable of manuevering the transfer window very well, attracting world-class footballers from other large teams like Mesut Özil (Real Madrid), Alexis Sanchez (Barcelona), Petr Cech (Chelsea), Danny Welbeck (Manchester United), and </p>
